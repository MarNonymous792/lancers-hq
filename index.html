            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to Lancers HQ!
                At Lancers HQ, we are a group of duelists passionate about playing and showcasing our hobby - the
                Yu-Gi-Oh card game.
                <br>
                <br>
                At Lancers HQ, we strive to foster a supportive and engaging community through tutorials, discussions,
                gameplay showcases, and live duels. Our goal is to share the thrill of the game, one duel at a time,
                while inspiring others to join the fun. We're passionate about Yu-Gi-Oh! and committed to helping others
                develop their skills, form friendships, and enjoy this incredible hobby to its fullest.

            <p>At Lancers HQ, our mission is to share our beloved hobby with others and invite new players into the
                exciting world of Yu-Gi-Oh! We are dedicated to creating an inviting and welcoming community where
                players of all skill levels can feel at home.
                <br><br>
                We strive to play with fellow duelists, fostering friendships and encouraging the growth of the
                community. By sharing strategies, hosting duels, and providing support to players both new and
                experienced, we aim to help every duelist enhance their skills and passion for the game. Our goal is not
                only to grow as players ourselves but also to contribute to the overall growth and spirit of the

            <p>At Lancers HQ, our vision is to create a large and vibrant community where duelists from all walks of
                life can come together to share their love for Yu-Gi-Oh! and engage in friendly competition. We aspire
                to become a hub for passionate players, where camaraderie, skill-building, and a shared love for the
                game flourish.

                Our long-term goal is to grow into a thriving community that not only connects duelists locally but also
                competes at the national, regional, and even international levels. We aim to nurture talent, promote
                healthy competition, and establish a presence in major Yu-Gi-Oh! events, all while maintaining the
                inclusive and welcoming spirit of Lancers HQ.</p>
